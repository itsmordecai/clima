# Clima ‚òÅ

## Our Goal

The objective was to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. How to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.

## What you will create

A weather app inspired by the designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). The app was able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

iOS version:
